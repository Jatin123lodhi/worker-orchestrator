we want to build a service called worker orchestrator
In a system where each user need one ec2 instance
this orchestrator service will help to assign ec2 instance to each 
from the asg, programatically changing the desired capacity of machines
as per the traffic so the new user don't need to wait most of the time

It will be helpful in an application on online code editor applicaiton
where each user can write code in vscode like envirmonent 
as each user has access to sinlge ec2 instance 

Steps I have taken - 

// let's just create an ec2 instance 
// install docker in it
// run our coder-server+nodejs image as we want vs code running in it

// create an ami from it
// create an template using the ami
// create an asg using the template

// test the single instance of asg  - running


// create an iam user with access to ec2 and asg
// create secret key and access key for that user
// added in env file


// write the end points to programatically handle the asg desired capacity
// we are able to set the desired capacity using the aws asg client
// now we need to find a machine for a particular projectId
